## üõ†Ô∏è About Me

I'm a DevOps engineer with experience in automation, continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD), cloud infrastructure management, and implementing reliable monitoring systems. I specialize in the prompt identification and quality resolution of infrastructure issues to ensure uninterrupted service operation. My goal is to create efficient, scalable, and reliable systems that help development teams work faster and more productively.

- üî≠ I'm currently working on **building application deployment processes in test and production Kubernetes clusters using the GitOps approach** (GitHub Actions, Rancher, Harbor, Kubernetes, Helm Charts, ArgoCD, Argo Rollouts)
- üå± I'm studying and **preparing for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03) certification**
- üí¨ Ask me about **DevOps, Kubernetes, CI/CD, infrastructure automation**
